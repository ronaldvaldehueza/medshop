AkcesMed Aurora Stroller
Aurora® is an advanced special needs stroller that combines a new generation design with a modern look.

The adjustable cushions and side supports provide excellent lateral stabilization. In addition, there is the possibility of changing the height of the headrest, the angle of the backrest and the footrest.
